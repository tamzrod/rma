# RMA Architecture Lock

This document freezes the high-level architecture of RMA.

Any change to:
- core responsibilities
- memory ownership rules
- adapter boundaries
- concurrency model

MUST require:
- an explicit design discussion
- a new architecture revision
- justification for breaking compatibility

RMA is architecture-first.
Code exists to serve this document, not the other way around.
